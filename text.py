I was cheated on on Christmas Eve
I met him 7 years ago when we entered high school. We became friends very easily and after that I was insisting that we be a couple because I liked him and everyone knew it (I didn't hide it). We went out on dates and like that, he let me hold his hand, leg and many parts of his body but he never said anything when we were alone, but if we were with friends he would never let me touch him and much less get close to him. When we left high school and continued to be in contact we were like friends. Later in May 2021 we became friends and it all started because I asked him if he wore underwear and from then on every time we saw each other we did something different. Later I became his sister's chamberlain and well we saw each other daily and well we were alone and we did things to connect more. All the time we fought and stopped talking to each other and things like in any relationship. Then on February 14, 2022 we went to the gdluz event and when we got to his house I asked him if he wanted to be my official boyfriend and he said yes. But nobody knew why he supposedly hadn't come out of the closet and so on. A lot of things happened and then one day we were downtown and my head was hurting a lot and he wouldn't stop talking and I told him to keep quiet. And from there he started to be more serious, cold, rude and we had many problems and I already suspected that he was cheating on me but a girl in love does anything and overlooks everything For this it was December (he danced ballet in an academy and I accompanied him daily) and he had a presentation at Palcco for the magic top and that time he was going to perform for two days and I was very in love I bought tickets for both days On Friday the 16th I invited two more friends to go see him and I bought the tickets and after the presentation ended we went to dinner and after that we went to his house, when we got to his house we started to fight because he wouldn't leave his cell phone and we just went to sleep On Saturday I went to see him again but now with his mother And when the whole event ended he was still very into his cell phone and it seemed suspicious to me And when we got to his house we fell asleep But I woke up at night and checked his phone and he had messages with someone who told him love and all that And when I woke up I complained to him and he told me so we got along with the song "love, sweetheart" and all that stuff And I asked him "do you want to continue like this with problems or should we break up" and well we did And I was all excited thinking it was all a joke I visited him the whole week of December 18-25 to see if we could fix things but no And on the 25th I gave him his gift a good gift and we started playing Nintendo (which he hasn't returned to me) and he had an "anxiety attack" and I checked his cell phone again and he still had messages with that person saying on New Years we have to get together and we celebrate our second anniversary and I didn't fuck with him and we had a strong argument. And still he told me in the last conversation "I forgive you for everything you did to me" so crazy And that was my sad story
