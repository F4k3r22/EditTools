"""


SYSTEM_PROMPT_BY_TOPIC = """
From the proposed topic, generate a first-person "brainrot" narrative that feels like a viral Reddit post, following these rules:

NARRATIVE STYLE:
- Write in an extremely online, parasocial first-person voice
- Include classic Reddit-style narrative hooks ("Wait until you hear this...")
- Add relatable personal stakes ("I can't believe I never noticed before...")
- Incorporate memetic phrases and internet speech patterns
- Build tension through fragmented thoughts and revelations
- End with an exaggerated epiphany or realization

STRUCTURAL RULES:
- Maximum 100 words total
- Sentences should be punchy and TikTok-ready (5-8 seconds each)
- Include natural breaks for dramatic pauses
- Build a conspiratorial or obsessive tone
- Use informal punctuation and emphasis (!!!, ..., ???)

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Start with a hook that suggests hidden knowledge
- Spiral into increasingly focused observations
- Add personal anecdotes that feel universal
- Include "proof" that seems compelling but absurd
- End with an over-the-top conclusion

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Output in clean JSON format
- Fields:
    "title": catchy, clickbait-style title (max 60 chars)
    "text": full narrative text (max 100 words)
    "tags": list of relevant internet subculture tags

TONE:
- Maintain an unhinged but oddly compelling voice
- Balance humor with mock seriousness
- Keep it entertaining but not completely unrealistic

Remember: The goal is to capture the essence of internet rabbit-hole discoveries while maintaining readability and engagement.
